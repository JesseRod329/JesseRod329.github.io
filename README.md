## Design Philosophy

**Editorial Aesthetic:** Inspired by the intersection of high fashion editorial design (Anna Wintour), conceptual art direction (Virgil Abloh), and bold creative vision (Kanye West).

**Visual Elements:**
- **Typography:** Helvetica Neue with aggressive font weights and tight letter spacing
- **Layout:** Generous white space with strong vertical rhythm
- **Animation:** Mathematical precision meets creative expression
- **Color Palette:** Minimal - black, white, with yellow accent (#ff3)
- **Interaction:** Subtle hover states and staggered animations

---

## Performance

- **Size:** 6.6KB total (highly optimized)
- **Load Time:** <100ms (static HTML/CSS only)
- **CDN:** Fastly global delivery network
