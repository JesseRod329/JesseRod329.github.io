# WaveOS MVP Foundation

## ✅ Completed

### Supabase Backend
- ✅ Database schema with all tables (profiles, beacons, waves, chats, chat_messages, ghost_zones, blocks, reports, presence)
- ✅ RLS policies for strict data isolation and privacy
- ✅ Edge functions:
  - `beacon-register` - Register new ephemeral beacon IDs
  - `beacon-resolve` - Server-side beacon→user resolution
  - `wave-handshake` - Handle mutual wave creation and chat initialization
  - `presence-cleanup` - Scheduled cleanup of stale data

### Expo App
- ✅ Project initialization with TypeScript
- ✅ Dependencies configured (BLE, Navigation, Supabase)
- ✅ BLE service for scanning, advertising, and beacon rotation
- ✅ Core screens:
  - Onboarding (auth, permissions, ghost zone setup)
  - Discovery (nearby users count)
  - Wave Handshake (mutual wave detection)
  - Chat (5-minute timed chat)
- ✅ React Navigation setup
- ✅ Context providers (Auth, Presence, Chat)
- ✅ Permission handling utilities

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Set up Supabase project:**
   - Create project at https://supabase.com
   - Run migrations: `supabase db push`
   - Deploy edge functions: `supabase functions deploy <function-name>`
   - Set up cron job for `presence-cleanup`

2. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add Supabase credentials

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **iOS Setup:**
   - Note: `react-native-ble-manager` doesn't support advertising on iOS
   - May need native module or alternative library for iOS BLE advertising

5. **Testing:**
   - Test BLE scanning/advertising on physical devices
   - Verify Supabase edge functions
   - Test auth flow and chat functionality

## 📝 Notes

- BLE advertising on iOS requires additional setup (native module or alternative library)
- Generate proper TypeScript types from Supabase: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/services/supabase/database.types.ts`
- Set up Supabase cron job for `presence-cleanup` edge function
- Configure app icons and splash screens in `assets/` directory
